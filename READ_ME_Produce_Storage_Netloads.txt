READ_ME

This file contains a function which returns a dataframe containing data about a Photovoltaic farm's behaviour with hydrogen and ammonia storage. The dataframe uses data from an external csv file with the PV electricity generated.

INPUTS:

PV_a: PV Farm structure output of <Produce_PV_Farm_Structure>
Annual_Demand_end: the electrical energy out (in kWh) which is required over the course of a year

capacity_a: the capacity of the PV farm (W)

H2: class with following attributes:
    eff_h2: the end-to-end (electrical-to-electrical) efficiency of hydrogen storage
    p_cap_h2: the power capacity (kWh/day) of hydrogen storage process
    e_cap_h2: the energy capacity (kWh) of hydrogen storage process
    h2_soc_start: the starting state of charge (kWh) kept in H2 storage

NH3: class with following attributes:
    eff_nh3: the end-to-end (electrical-to-electrical) efficiency of ammonia storage
    p_cap_nh3: the power capacity (kWh/day) of ammonia storage process
    e_cap_nh3: the energy capacity (kWh) of ammonia storage process
    nh3_soc_start: the starting state of charge (kWh) kept in NH3 storage

OUTPUTS:
PV_a_supp_demand: a dataframe with the following columns:
    electricity (kWh): electricity generated by PV farm
    Daily Demand (kWh): electrical daily demand of trains 
    Nondispatchable Net Load (kWh): net load if no storage used
    Net Load with H2 only (kWh): net load if we only had H2 storage
    H2 State of Charge (kWh): energy kept in H2 storage
    H2 Energy Output: energy flow in day out of H2 process
    Demand met by H2: the demand which is met electrically through H2
    Net Load with NH3: net load if we have H2 and NH3
    NH3 State of Charge (kWh): energy kept in NH3 storage
    NH3 Energy Output (kWh): energy flow in day out of NH3 process
    Demand met by NH3: the demand which is met electrically through NH3
